      <p><b><i>My name is Cindy Grimes, </i></b>and I am a long arm quilter. 
        I was born and raised here, in the great state of Indiana, at the 
        Crossroads of America – Indianapolis! I have lived here all of my life,
        and am proud to be called a Hoosier! My long arm quilting service is
        called, <b><i>Who’s Yer Quilter?</i></b> The answer to that question 
        could be Cindy from Indy!</p>
      <p>A little background information about me. I have always wanted to 
        learn how to quilt, and in 2000, I was introduced to someone who was 
        a long-time quilter. I told her that I wanted to try quilting, but I 
        was somewhat apprehensive, since I was not a seamstress. She said, 
        “quilting is very easy – you just cut the fabric into little pieces 
        and sew them back together again!” That was all the motivation I needed
        to begin. She helped me pick out my first quilt block design – 
        a log cabin. We went to the fabric store, purchased some fabric and 
        quilting notions, and the next thing I knew, I had finished my 
        very first quilt. I made that first quilt top on a Kenmore machine, 
        which I continue to use today. I also have a Janome 4120 QDC machine 
        that I sew on as well.
