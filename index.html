        <b><i>My name is Cindy Grimes, </i></b>and I am a long arm quilter. I
        was born and raised here, in the great state of Indiana, at the
        Crossroads of America – Indianapolis! I have lived here all of my life,
        and am proud to be called a Hoosier! My long arm quilting service is
        called, <b><i>Who’s Yer Quilter?</i></b> The answer to that question
        could be Cindy from Indy!

        <b><i>A little background information about me.</i></b> I have always
        wanted to learn how to quilt, and in 2000, I was introduced to someone
        who was a long-time quilter. I told her that I wanted to try quilting,
        but I was somewhat apprehensive, since I was not a seamstress. She said,
        “quilting is very easy – you just cut the fabric into little pieces and
        sew them back together again!” That was all the motivation I needed to
        begin. She helped me pick out my first quilt block design – a log cabin.
        We went to the fabric store, purchased some fabric and quilting notions,
        and the next thing I knew, I had finished my very first quilt. I made
        that first quilt top on a Kenmore machine, which I continue to use
        today. I also have a Janome 4120 QDC machine that I sew on as well.

        <b><i>And now, a little bit about “Big Bertha.”</i></b
        >My long arm machine is an ABM International Innova 22 Lightning Stitch
        with a 12-foot table. I affectionately call my machine “Big Bertha.” She
        got her nickname because whenever my friends and family come to visit my
        quilting studio for the first time, they all say, “I had no idea it was
        that big!” But bigger is better, because that means that I can quilt
        anything from a baby blanket to a king size bed quilt! I purchased “Big
        Bertha” in 2018, from Accomplish Quilting, right here in Indy. Bertha
        and I have been working together, completing charity quilts for the
        Quilting Guild of Indianapolis. My long arm quilting service style is
        edge to edge, using pantographs.

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>I am married to my beloved husband, Steve.</li>
          <li>
            In 2004, I entered a quilt into the Indiana State Fair, and was
            awarded a 3rd Place Ribbon.
          </li>
          <li>
            My favorite TV show as a child, was Little House on the Prairie. I
            enjoy learning about history, so what better way to connect history
            with a hobby?! I love using Civil War or 1930’s reproduction fabrics
            to make quilt tops.
          </li>
          <li>
            Other hobbies that I enjoy (when I’m not quilting): gardening,
            cooking, and bird-watching.
          </li>
          <li>
            Little-known secret!!! I don’t have a fabric stash! I only purchase
            enough fabric to complete the current project that I am working on
            at the time. Please keep this under your hat (ha-ha).

      <p>
        <b><i>Thank you for letting me introduce myself to you!</i></b> It is my
        hope that you won’t send your quilt top outside of the Hoosier State to
        be completed, but instead, have your project finished locally. Perhaps
        you will even allow me – Cindy from Indy, to turn your quilt into a
        hometown heirloom for you!
